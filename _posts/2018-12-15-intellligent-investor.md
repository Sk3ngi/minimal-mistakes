 - Make fundamental analysis of companies you invest in
 - Protect yourself against serious losses
 - Don't be too greedy: aim at correct return 
 - Two kind of investors:
   - Defensive: saves money, little mistakes, controlled risk and decent return. Bonds + common stocks
   - Enterprising (aggressive): Select market-beating stocks - undervaluated - and grow them. Speculation

 - Take into account in risk profile analysis
 - Mitigate inflation with Real Estate Investment Trusts and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities
### Chapter 3 Stock Market History

 - Do not overtrust the "forecasting power"
