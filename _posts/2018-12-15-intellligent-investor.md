 - Two kinds of investors:
   - Defensive: saves money, little mistakes, controlled risk and decent return. Bonds + common stocks
   - Enterprising (aggressive): Select market-beating stocks - undervaluated - and grow them. Speculation

### Chapter 3: Stock Market History
 - Do not assume that the future is based on the past
 - Do not overtrust the "experts"
 - Do not overtrust the "forecasting power"
### Chapter 4:
Risk aversion determined by personal situation. What can you afford to lose?
