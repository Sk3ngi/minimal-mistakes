## Key concepts
### Chapter 1: Invest vs Speculate
 - Make fundamental analysis of companies you invest in
 - Protect yourself against serious losses
 - Don't be too greedy: aim at correct return 
 - Two kinds of investors:
   - Defensive: saves money, little mistakes, controlled risk and decent return. Bonds + common stocks
   - Enterprising (aggressive): Select market-beating stocks - undervaluated - and grow them. Speculation
### Chapter 2: Investor and inflation
 - How much is kept after inflation?
 - Take into account in risk profile analysis
 - Mitigate inflation with Real Estate Investment Trusts and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities
### Chapter 3: Stock Market History
 - Do not assume that the future is based on the past
 - Do not overtrust the "experts"
 - Do not overtrust the "forecasting power"
### Chapter 4: Defensive principles
Risk aversion determined by personal situation. What can you afford to lose?
 - 25% minimum in bonds in order to keep investing even though the market collapses
 - 75% max of total assets invested in stocks
 - **Pick between 10 and 30 stocks if self-picked. Avoid industry concentrarion**
 - Should not require more work than a couple of hours per month on total investments with defensive portfolio
### Chapter 6: Enterprising investor
 - Avoid day trading: extreme risk
 - Avoid IPO (often overpriced)
 - Extreme caution with foreign bonds
 - **The bigger the firm gets, the slower it grows. Avoid a price/earnings ratios above 25-30**
 - **Be on the lookout for temp unpopularity which enables you to buy a great company at a good price**
### Chapter 8: Investor and market fluctuation
 - If fancy speculation, separate it from investment, limit the amount and be ready to lose it all
 - Good stock: price is close to asset value, good ratio of earning to price, strong financial position and will last over the years
### Chapter 9: Investment funds
 - The higher a fundâ€™s expenses, the lower its returns
 - The more frequently a fund trades its stocks, the less it tends to earn
 - Highly volatile funds, which bounce up and down more than average, are likely to stay volatile
